## Installation

1. `cd API`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev` or `nodemon index`

### Note

This app is aimed to be for testing only and is NOT meant to be deployed to production. It lacks request validation, security checks, error handlers and a lot more.

## Getting Started

It comprises of `MongoDB`, `Express`, and `Node`. `MongoDB`, `Express`, `Node` for **back-end development**

## Development

### Installed Packages

1. `npm init -y`
        this creates package.json file
2. npm install express mongoose cors nodemon
        this installs these packages
3. Create index.js file, this will contain all connection information
4. Create user.js in models folder this will create or fetch user
5. Use postman (or thunderclient a visual studio extension for verifying connection right from visual studio).

+ `npm install -D nodemon` to be able to see changes instantly without reinitializing the server (hot reloading).
+ `npm i express`

Then we created several scripts to agilize development

```json
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "nodemon index.js",
        "start": "node index.js",
        "lint": "eslint"
    },
```
